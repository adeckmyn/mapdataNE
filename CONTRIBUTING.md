##Naming
Any help in correcting/completing the naming of all polygons would be appreciated. For instance, the world10 data set contains many more islands than e.g. the old worldHires set, and even there a lot of names were missing. 

All names are implemented in readable form in e.g. the file src/world10.name
You can send me an edited name file, or just a list of identifications.

The usual naming scheme is something like
*Country* for the central polygon of a country
*Country:Part* for countries consisting of several part (e.g. islands)
Unidentified parts are just numbered in the order they appear in the Natural Earth shapefile.
*Country:Island group:Island* Yes, this also happens.

Currently, only a small proportion of all islands are correctly named. The names have mainly been taken from the original worldHires set. Obvious changes in country names are all fixed, but there remain a lot of unnamed polygons.
