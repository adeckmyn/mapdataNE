#TO DO
I don't plan to work much on the C code etc. in this package. Unless problems arise, of course.

The actual polygons/lines are currently from Natural Earth v3.1.0 (December 2013). 

- Add rivers & lakes data sets.
- Add world50 dataset for a lower resolution and less islands.
- Add world110 for large maps.
- Continuing effort on *polygon names*:
  * Correct any mistakes (I'm sure there are many)
  * Identify more of the unnamed polygons (mostly small islands). Not a priority.
