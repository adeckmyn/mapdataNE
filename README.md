#mapdataNE
### a supplement R package to maps

This R package contains map data similar to the existing mapdata package. The data is derived from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com).

The R and C code in this package are derived from "mapdata" maintained by Ray Brownrigg.

##DATA SOURCE

All data in this package was derived from the Natural Earth project
http://www.naturalearthdata.com

- 1/10m scale world dataset (world10, lakes10, rivers10):
ne_10m_admin_countries_lakes version 3.1.0 (December 2013)

- 1/50m scale world dataset (world50): slightly lower resolution

All data is in the public domain.

The data was reformatted for use with the maps package.


##C CODE

The C and R code in this package was adapted from the "mapdata" package at CRAN, maintained by Ray Brownrigg.

##POLYGON NAMES

The naming of the polygons is as close as possible to that in the original maps data base. Not all small islands are named. These may be identified in future versions (help is welcome).
